        <h1>Juliana Eichsteadt</h1>
        Hello world, I'm Juliana. Welcome to my website! 

        <h2>My Interests</h2>

        <p>At the most basic level of description, I am an animal lover. I work at a rescue barn with horses, goats, pigs, chickens, sheep, and any other type of farm animal you can conceive of. I've also pretty much owned every type of pet you could own at one point or another</p>
        <p>Since I am still in school, owning a lot of animals is too big of a responsibility so I have had to limit my intake. I currently have two guinea pigs named Cookie and Ozzy that I rescued.</p>
        <p>My guinea pigs are my everything and I can't imagine living without any animal at all. They are my therapy and the loves of my life.</p>

        <h2>FOOOOOD</h2>

        <p>I have never understood people who eat to live.... I live to eat!! Here's a list of some of my favorite restauraunts in my area</p>

        <ul>

        </ul>

        <h2>Barn Life</h2>

        <p>As I mentioned previously in the above text, I work at a barn. Every animal I work with has their own distinct personality. Below I will include a table indicating some of the animal's names, species, and colors</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Species</th>
                <th>Color</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Plenty</td>
                <td>horse</td>
