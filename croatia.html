        <h3>Background</h3>
        <section>
            <p>The lands that today comprise Croatia were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the close of World War I. In <time datetime="1918">1918</time> the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after <time datetime="1929">1929</time> as Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia became a federal independent communist state consisting of six socialist republics under the strong hand of Marshal Josip Broz, aka TITO.</p>
            <p>Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in <time datetime="1991">1991</time> it took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting before Yugoslav forces were cleared from Croatian lands, along with a majority of Croatia's ethnic Serb population. Under UN supervision, the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was returned to Croatia in <time datetime="1998">1998</time> The country joined <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr> in <time datetime="2009-04">April 2009</time> and the EU in <time datetime="2013-07">July 2013</time>.</p>
            <p>In <time datetime="2023-01">January 2023</time>, Croatia further integrated into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> by joining the Eurozone and the Schengen Area.</p>
