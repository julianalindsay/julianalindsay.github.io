            The two F’s encompass everything that is important in life. In my family, food is life. It’s a reason to get together and show our love for each other. Because of the way I was raised to see food as a means of communication, it quite literally has become my love language. Feeding people is how I like to show gratitude and affection.

            Over the years, I have accumulated hundreds of recipes - some passed down for generations and some that have been shared between me and my mom, just for us. This site serves as a filing cabinet for some of my most cherished recipes that I hope to one day cook for my own children and continue the customary love for the two F’s.
