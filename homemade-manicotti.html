                I wonâ€™t lie, this recipe is definitely a labor of love, but tasting that fresh homemade pasta at the end of it makes everything worth it. There is absolutely no equivalent to sitting down to a dish of this stuffed homemade manicotti knowing that you spent the whole day preparing everything from scratch. This dish obviously goes best with the addition of that homemade sunday sauce and Italian meatballs, but there is no shame in cutting corners if need be. After all, you did just spend the entire day making pasta.

                Now, remember that this recipe is going to make a lot of manicotti. That's ok! You can store leftovers in the freezer if you aren't looking to feed a whole crowd. But, think about how impressed everyone will be at that potluck if you show up with a dish like this. Vegetarian friendly and foolproof for picky eaters - this pasta dish has it all!
