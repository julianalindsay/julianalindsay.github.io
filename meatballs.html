            It seems that pretty much every Italian family had their own recipe for meatballs. In my family, we like ours big with extra fennel. The same simple ingredients apply to any traditional Italian meatballs, but my family chooses to exclude veal from our recipe. These babies (more like toddlers because of the size) are an accompaniment to <a href="sunday-sauce.html">Sunday sauce</a> and are rarely, if ever,  served separately. Dabble some of that sauce on top of pasta with a couple of your giant meatballs and you have a meal so legendary it could be requested on Death Row.
