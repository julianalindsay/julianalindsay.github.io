            A lot of people underestimate the versatility of the artichoke. They are usually only sourced for their hearts which can be used on salads, in dips, and on pizza. Well, let me turn you on to stuffed artichokes. Anyone who enjoys ditching their utensils for some good old-fashioned finger food will love these. I, for one, have always loved peeling apart each leaf one by one and scraping off all that delicious stuffing with my teeth. Thereâ€™s just something so satisfying about it. This recipe is fairly simple, but makes for a great meal all on its own.

                Trim the lips of the artichoke leaves with a scissor and cut the stems evenly so they can sit up straight. Then,spread the leaves open as much as possible being careful not to break them. Stuff the artichoke leaves with your stuffing mixture getting it into as many crevices as possible.

                Fill a large sauce pot with 2 inch deep water. Place the stuffed artichokes into the pot and sprinkle lemon juice and pasmesan cheese on the tops. Cook on medium to low heat with a cover on for as long is it takes for the leaves to begin to soften. Be sure the water doesn't entirely evaporate and add more if it does. The longer they can cook the better they will be. Cook for a minimum for 4 hours.
