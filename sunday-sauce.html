            In my family Sunday dinner is not something that is optional. We have always felt that it is necessary to gather once a week and keep family ties strong. Ever since my grandmother and grandfather passed away two years ago, Sunday dinner traditions have become more difficult to keep on the calendar. However, despite the grandkids getting older and the matriarch of the family being gone, Sunday dinner is something that will always keep us together. Waking up to the smell of a giant homemade pot of sauce just hits different - there’s nothing like it! So, whether you call it sauce or gravy, this staple item is something that is non negotiable for family get-togethers. The portion sizes for this recipe are large enough to feed an entire family; and I’m not just talking about mom, dad and kids. I’m talking about aunts, uncles, grandparents, and grandkids.

            <p>Because I have made this recipe so many times at this point, I don't typically use exact measurements. Instead, once you have the taste for it you're pretty much able to eye most of the ingredients. For the purpose of storing this recipe in my virtual filing cabinet I have written out exact measurements.</p>

            Pro Tip! The earlier you start your sauce, the better flavor profile you will develop and the thicker your sauce will be.
