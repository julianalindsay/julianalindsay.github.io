            <p>People tend to think that homemade pasta is too out of reach for a typical weeknight dinner. However, this super simple sweet potato gnocchi will certainly change their minds. With just two ingredients, it’s not only easy but it tastes absolutely incredible!</p>
            <p>Keep in mind these little balls of deliciousness are extremely filling and extra hardy, making this a perfect dish for wintertime. I usually prepare my sweet potato gnocchi with a simple pink sauce, but you’ll get the best flavor experience using a lighter butter sauce.</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <p>Cook the sweet potatoes in the oven for 40 minutes at 350°F. Make sure to poke holes in the skin. Once sweet potatoes are cooled, remove the skin and place the insides into a bowl. Using a fork, mash the sweet potato into a paste until it’s as smooth as possible. At this point, mix in the salt.</p>
            <p>On a large cutting board or clean kitchen counter, make the flour into a mound with an indent at the top. Place the sweet potato mash into the indent and combine until you have a smooth dough ball. Separate the dough ball into four smaller dough balls. One at a time, roll the balls into long cylinders. Cut into about 1 inch portions. Dump gnocchi into bowling salt water and remove once floating. Serve with your favorite sauce and you’re done!</p>
